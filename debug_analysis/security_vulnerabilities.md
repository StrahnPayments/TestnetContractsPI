# Security Vulnerabilities Analysis

## Critical Issues

### 1. **Mandate Record - Creator Verification Bypass**
**File**: `contracts/mandate_record.py`
**Line**: `release_mandate_funds()` in PI Base
**Issue**: The security check uses `AppParam.creator()` which can be manipulated

```python
# VULNERABLE CODE:
caller_creator = AppParam.creator(Txn.sender())
Assert(caller_creator.value() == Global.current_application_address())
```

**Problem**: An attacker could create a malicious application with the PI Base as creator, then call `release_mandate_funds()`.

**Fix**: Use a whitelist of authorized mandate contracts instead of relying on creator field.

### 2. **Strahn Core - Box Storage Race Condition**
**File**: `contracts/strahn_core.py`
**Line**: `deploy_mandate()` function
**Issue**: Bytecode verification and deployment are not atomic

```python
# VULNERABLE CODE:
approval_code = App.box_get(Bytes("approval"))
# ... other operations ...
deploy_internal(approval_code.value(), clear_code.value())
```

**Problem**: Owner could update bytecode between verification and deployment.

**Fix**: Use atomic operations or add version numbers to bytecode.

### 3. **PI Base - Signature Replay Across Contracts**
**File**: `contracts/strahn_pi_base.py`
**Issue**: Signatures don't include contract-specific context

```python
# VULNERABLE CODE:
message = Concat(
    Bytes("SPP_V1:"),
    Itob(nonce),
    destination,
    Itob(amount),
    Itob(relayer_fee)
)
```

**Problem**: Same signature could be replayed across different PI Base contracts.

**Fix**: Include contract address in signature message.

## Medium Issues

### 4. **Mandate Record - Timestamp Manipulation**
**File**: `contracts/mandate_record.py`
**Line**: `process_payment()` function
**Issue**: Relies on `Global.latest_timestamp()` which can be manipulated by validators

```python
# POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE:
current_time = Global.latest_timestamp()
Assert(current_time >= next_payment_time)
```

**Impact**: Payments could be processed slightly early or late.

**Mitigation**: Add tolerance window or use block-based timing.

### 5. **PI Base - Insufficient Balance Check**
**File**: `contracts/strahn_pi_base.py`
**Issue**: No explicit balance verification before payments

**Problem**: Contract could attempt payments without sufficient USDC balance.

**Fix**: Add balance checks before inner transactions.

### 6. **Core Contract - Unlimited Bytecode Size**
**File**: `contracts/strahn_core.py`
**Issue**: No size limits on stored bytecode

**Problem**: Could lead to excessive storage costs or DoS.

**Fix**: Add reasonable size limits for bytecode.
